# CodKiller Game Engine Documentation (Alpha Version)
Introduction
CodKiller is a game engine designed to facilitate the development of 2D games with features such as map editing, rendering, and agent behavior. This documentation provides an overview of the engine's functionality and usage instructions for the alpha version.
Features
The CodKiller game engine offers the following features:

1. Map Editing: The engine provides a Map class that allows users to create and edit game maps. Maps can include floors, walls, and ceilings, and can be rendered with 3D effects.

2. Rendering: The engine supports rendering maps and agents on a canvas using the HTML5 Canvas API. Walls are drawn with a disappearing effect, giving the illusion of shrinking from the user's point of view.

3. Agent Behavior: The engine includes an Agent class that represents game agents. Agents can be loaded from a JSON file, and their positions, velocities, and awareness attributes can be customized. Agents can move within the game environment and interact with other elements.
Usage Instructions
To use the CodKiller game engine, follow these steps:

1. Include the map.js file in your project.

2. Create an instance of the Map class, providing the canvas ID, user view position, and user spawn position as parameters.

3. Customize the map by adding floors, walls, and ceilings using the addFloorObject method of the Map class.

4. Load agents from a JSON file using the loadAgentsFromJSON method of the Map class. The JSON file should contain an array of agent objects, each specifying the agent's position, velocity, and awareness.

5. Implement the update method of the Agent class to define the behavior of the agents. This method should update the agent's position and state based on its velocity and awareness.

6. Implement the draw method of the Agent class to visually represent the agents on the canvas.

7. Start the rendering loop by calling the startRendering method of the Map instance.
Limitations
The alpha version of CodKiller has the following limitations:

1. Untested: The alpha version has not been thoroughly tested, so there may be bugs or unexpected behavior.

2. Basic Functionality: The engine provides basic functionality for map editing, rendering, and agent behavior. Advanced features such as collision detection, user input handling, and game logic are not included in this version.

3. Limited Documentation: The documentation provided for the alpha version is limited to the features and usage instructions features and usage instructions. More detailed documentation will be provided in future versions.


#Conclusion
The CodKiller game engine is a promising tool for developing 2D games with map editing, rendering, and agent behavior capabilities. While the alpha version has limitations and is untested, it serves as a foundation for further development and refinement.

Please note that this documentation only covers the alpha version of CodKiller. As the engine evolves, additional features, improvements, and bug fixes will be introduced. Stay tuned for future updates and releases.
